    <h1>Help page for the MI-IEA-EC-OECD Survey on Clean Energy Innovation Policy</h1>

    <h2>Survey introduction</h2>
    <p>The MI-IEA-EC-OECD Survey on Clean Energy Innovation Policy is a collaborative effort between the International Energy Agency (IEA), Mission Innovation (MI), and the Science, Technology and Innovation Directorate (STI) of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), in partnership with the European Commission (EC). All organisations regularly collect data on research and innovation policies related to net zero, and the purpose of this survey is to streamline data collection into a single, comprehensive questionnaire, thereby reducing the reporting burden on national authorities. The survey aims to gather accurate and valuable data on policy initiatives targeting the decarbonisation of the energy sector.</p>
    
    <p>The information collected in the survey is relevant to all organisations. Accordingly, the information collected by MI will be collated into the <a href="https://mission-innovation.net/innovation-platform-insights/member-insights-report-launch/">MI Member Insights Report</a>, an annual report that aims to provide a snapshot of government clean-energy STI policy initiatives. The IEA will use the collected data to enhance its <a href="https://www.iea.org/policies/about">Policies and Measures Database (PAMS)</a>, which provides access to information related to past, existing and planned government policies and measures for clean energy technologies. The OECD will use the data to feed the EC-OECD <a href="https://stip.oecd.org/stip/net-zero-portal">STIP Compass portal</a>, which provides information on hundreds of STI policies that explicitly support the transition to <a href="https://stip.oecd.org/stip/net-zero-portal">net zero</a>.</p>

    <h2>Survey structure</h2>
    <p>The surveyâ€™s structure comprises four taxonomies characterising policy initiatives in different ways:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Themes/questions.</li>
        <li>Direct beneficiaries.</li>
        <li>Instruments.</li>
        <li>Technologies.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Themes correspond to the different questions asked in the survey. Respondents provide data on policy initiatives in response to the different question, and policy initiatives may be linked to several themes. For each policy initiative, direct beneficiaries, what is a policy instrument? and technologies should be selected.</p>

    <p>In addition, the survey collects more detailed data on policy instruments, that respondents should provide to the degree possible for them.</p>
